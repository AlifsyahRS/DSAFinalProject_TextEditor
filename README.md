# Data Structures and Algorithms Text Editor Final Project
###### By Alifsyah Rizky Sutarjadi, Rafian Athallah Marchansyah, and Wais Ibrahim

This is our final project submission for our Data Structures and Algorithm Course. Our repository should have a word document containing our project report and the code that we used in the making of this project. We also attached a google drive link containing the video demo for our project. The file size was quite large and therefore, it's hard to push it to git so we decided to just put it on a google drive instead.
